# Send

Sends made within the Nata Network between zkAccounts are fully private. You do not transfer to an 0x account, but rather to another zkAccount holder's generated shielded address or alias. Typically, the receiver will send you their alias or zkAccount shield address via a private channel, invoice, or some other private method.&#x20;
