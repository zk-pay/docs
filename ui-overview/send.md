# Send

Sends are made within the ZKPay network between zkAccounts and are fully private. You do not transfer to an 0x account, but rather to another zkAccount holder's generated receiving address. Typically, the receiver will send you a another user's alias or zkAccount address via a private channel, invoice, or some other private method.&#x20;
