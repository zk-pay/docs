# Withdrawal Swaps

Sometimes merchants require payment in a specifc token, or in a token that ZKPay doesn't natively support. Users can specify a different asset than what they are withdrawing and swap to a different asset.\
\
For example, a user has zkDAI in their ZKPay account but wants to pay someone in USDC. This type of action is called a 'Withdrawal Swap'. \
\
1inch is used to perform the swap at the best market rate and then sent to the specified address. \
\
Any native ZKPay asset (zkDAI, zkETH, and zkMATIC) can be withdrawal swapped to:

* Polygon MATIC
* Polygon ETH
* Polygon DAI
* Polygon USDC
* Polygon USDT\


Withdrawal and withdrawal swaps to the Ethereum network supported later.&#x20;
