# ZKPay Fees

ZKPay collects a convenience fee for fast withdrawals and private L2 swaps. The fees are distributed to the LP pool providers. A Nata Network user normally has to **wait 6 hours** to withdrawal from the rollup but **ZKPay's fast withdrawals take less than 3 seconds.**&#x20;

* Deposits and private L2 Sends have 0% ZKPay fee.
* **zkSuperCoder holders are exempt from ZKPay fees.**\
