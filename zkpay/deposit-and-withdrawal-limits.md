# Deposit & Withdrawal Limits

Limits are imposed to protect against large deposits which may result from illegal activity (for example a hack where attackers need to quickly move a large amount of funds). By default, new users are limited in the amount they can deposit and withdraw. Established users or businesses with inherent KYC can access higher limits through tiered limits.

### Default Limits

1. A single deposit cannot exceed 10,000 DAI or 5 ETH or 10,000 MATIC.
2. A single address cannot deposit more than 10,000 DAI or 5 ETH or 10,000 MATIC during a single 24 hour period.
3. All deposits from all addresses (see tiers below for more info) cannot exceed 300,000 DAI or 150 ETH or 40,000 MATIC during a single 24 hour period.
4. During Beta, the overall size of a pool cannot exceed 1,000,000 DAI or 500 ETH or 250,000 MATIC  .

**Withdrawals**

1. All withdrawals from all addresses cannot exceed 100,000 DAI or 50 ETH or 100,000 MATIC during a single 24 hour period.
