# Deposit & Withdrawal Limits

Nata Network limits are imposed to protect against large deposits which may result from illegal activity (for example a hack where attackers need to quickly move a large amount of funds). By default, new users are limited in the amount they can deposit and withdraw.

### Default Limits

**Deposits**

* A single deposit cannot exceed 10,000 DAI or 5 ETH or 10,000 MATIC.
* A single address cannot deposit more than 10,000 DAI or 5 ETH or 10,000 MATIC during a single 24 hour period.

**Withdrawals**

* A single withdrawal cannot exceed 10,000 DAI or 5 ETH or 10,000 MATIC.

**Transfers**

* Transfers initiated inside the network are unlimited.&#x20;
