# Compliance & Security

## User Restrictions

ZKPay should not be used for any illegitimate or criminal activity nor supported by the direct or indirect proceeds of criminal or fraudulent activity. It should not be used in any way that violates any laws in the jurisdiction of the user.&#x20;

Politically exposed individuals or associates of those individuals are not permitted to use the application under existing laws.&#x20;

## Daily limits

Limits are imposed to prevent large-scale transactions which may be the result of illicit activity. [Deposit limits are detailed here](../deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md).

## Geo Restrictions

The ZKPay application is in Beta with minimal restrictions enabled. Users must abide by local, state and federal laws. **Please check prior to usage**. &#x20;

Post-beta, restrictions may be enabled for additional countries based on legal considerations.

## Wallet Compliance

An integration with TRM and potential future integrations with VAF Compliance and PureFi ensure 0x wallets interacting with the protocol do not contain funds obtained from illicit sources. Suspicious wallets cannot deposit into the protocol, and funds cannot be withdrawn to suspicious wallets.&#x20;

## Security



### Bug Bounty

Bounties are one of the most important tools for testing and enhancing application and contract security. We are in the planning phases to implement a bug bounty to help protect users and their funds.
