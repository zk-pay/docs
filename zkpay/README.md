# ZKPay

## About

ZKPay is a community built wallet for the Nata Network deployed on Polygon and designed for everyday users and common use cases. Nata Network uses zkSNARKS to anonymize senders, receivers, and amounts when transferring assets inside the network.

When a transfer is initiated inside the network, the amount and recipient is never disclosed or published publicly. Deposits, transfers and withdrawals are all processed on Polygon POS, with low gas fees included in the transfer amount.&#x20;

_\*Nata Network introduces_ _deposit and withdrawal limits_ _and other_ _compliance features_ _to keep the application and its users safe._ [_Transfers are limited by these pool constraints._](deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md)
