# ZKPay

## About

&#x20;ZKPay is a community build wallet for the PolyAztec Network deployed on Polygon and designed for everyday users and common use cases. PolyAztec uses zkSNARKS to anonymize senders, receivers, and amounts when transferring assets inside the network. Compliance features deter bad actors and illicit usage, giving privacy and safety back to ordinary blockchain users.

When a transfer is initiated inside the network, the amount and recipient is never disclosed or published publicly. Deposits, transfers and withdrawals are all processed on Polygon, with low gas fees included in the transfer amount.&#x20;

_\*ZKPay introduces_ _deposit and withdrawal limits_ _and other_ _compliance features_ _to keep the application and its users safe._ [_Transfers are limited by these pool constraints._](deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md)
